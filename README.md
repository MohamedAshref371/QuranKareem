I did not care about designing the form or adding forms yet, and instead I used the Guna UI 2.0 library.

Wanting to revive an idea from 2002 ([Quran-CD-Roaya-5](https://archive.org/download/QuranCDRoaya5/Quran-CD-Roaya-5.iso)), I built a mostly standardized SQLite database model.

I used [UthmanicHafs_v2-1](https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp02/حفص) from [King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex](https://qurancomplex.gov.sa/) to get the written Qur’an and convert it to [sqlite database](https://github.com/mohamedashref371/QuranKareem/blob/master/data/texts/حفص%20عن%20عاصم.db).
